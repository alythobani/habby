# Stay Habby

A habit tracker app, originally started by [Arie Milner](https://github.com/amilner42/habby) (Nov—Dec 2017) and currently only further developed by me (Dec 2017—present).

## Features

### Light Mode / Dark Mode / Add a Habit

This is where you start your journey!

### Habits Automatically Sorted

Your habits will be automatically sorted by urgency, completion, and progress in the current time fragment. This should hopefully help give you an idea of which habits you should prioritize, but it is by no means a dictation.

### Edit a Habit's Goal

Sometimes your goals change. You can update a habit's goal, and don't worry, your previous goals will still be taken into account when calculating your overall success percentage.

### Suspend and Resume Habits

Sometimes your priorities change. You can suspend and resume habits as you wish. When a habit is suspended, your performance on it will not impact your success percentage. You can still enter data for the habit if you want to track it.

### Keyboard Shortcut for Entering Habit Data

If you're too lazy to click the habit's box... just do a keyboard search for it.

### Track your Journey with Notes

Inspired by Cal Newport's [Deep Work](http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/).

Tracking "lead" measures (e.g. how many times this week you worked out) is more useful for long-term progress than tracking "lag" measures (e.g. how many PR's you hit in your workouts this week), because you have much more control over lead measures. This is the idea behind Habby: day-to-day actions are important and under your control.

But it's still quite useful to track lag measures, especially alongside your lead measure tracking. This can give you an idea of, for example, how many workouts it takes you to hit a personal record.

Note down a lag measure, or even just a diary entry, by adding a Note to a habit for the day.
